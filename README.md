# ArchRice
DEPRECATED, I wiped my arch partition as I will be formatting my disk and switching to gentoo soon enough.

It is also required to have some of my C scripts for tty text which I'll publish soon, and for you to adjust everything to the correct path.
Im also well aware that I've leaked my username, but this was never a private account, it was by choice.

Credits to:
-pijulius for the picom fork.
-Kali Linux for the zsh rice (even tho ported to arch).
-Suckless software
